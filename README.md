# SCAPS Simulations for Mixed Sn–Pb Perovskite Solar Cells

This repository contains SCAPS-1D simulation files used in the paper:

> **Hybrid sequential processing of mixed Sn-Pb 
narrow-bandgap perovskite solar cells**
> (2025)

## Contents
- `Pb0.3Sn0.7/` — Low bandgap Sn rich device
- `Pb0.5Sn0.5/` — Medium bandgap equimolar device
- `Pb0.7Sn0.3/` — Higher bandgap Pb-rich device
- Files exported from SCAPS (I–V)

## Notes
All simulations were run using **SCAPS-1D (University of Gent, version 3.3.12)**
